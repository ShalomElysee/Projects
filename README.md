# Small Projects - Code Experiments & Mini Applications 

This repository contains a collection of small projects, experiments, and coding challenges** that I have worked on.  
Each project explores a specific concept in software development, algorithms, backend engineering, or web development.  

## What You’ll Find Here  

- **Algorithms & Data Structures** – Sorting, Search, Pathfinding (A*, BFS, DFS).
- **Web Development** – Basic APIs, JavaScript mini-apps.
- **Embedded Computing (if applicable)** – Low-level programming and optimizations.
  
## How to Use This Repo  
Each subfolder contains a separate mini-project. To run a specific project:  

```bash
cd project-folder
python main.py  # Or follow specific README instructions inside the folder
